    "### Hints for the Task1:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To create a regular expression, which describes strings containing two patterns, where order of the patterns is not defined use the following so-called ‘positive lookahead assertion’ with “?=” group modifier. For example, both strings “Washington Irving” and “Irving Washington” match the pattern: “(?=.*Washington)(?=.*Irving)”.\n",
    "2. To capture groups use round brackets. So, the pattern: “(?=.*(Washington))(?=.*(Irving))” captures “Washington” and “Irving” from both strings: \"William Arthur Irving Washington was an English first-class Cricketer\" and: “Washington Irving was an American writer”.\n",
    "3. If any group is optional, use “?” modifier. So, the pattern: “(?=.*(Washington))(?=.*(Irving))?” captures “Washington” from the string “George Washington”.\n",
    "4. Use ‘\\b’ to specify boundaries of words and increase accuracy of your pattern. For example: pattern “(?=.*\\bID=(\\d+))(?=.*\\bUserID=(\\d+))” captures “1” and “2” from the string \"ID=1 UserID=2\", whereas pattern without ‘\\b’: “(?=.*ID=(\\d+))(?=.*UserID=(\\d+))” returns the wrong groups: “2” and “2”.\n",
    "5. In Hive pattern for the external table in SERDEPROPERTIES \"input.regex\" should describe the whole input string, so add “.*” at the end of the pattern.\n",
    "6. You can test your pattern with Hadoop Streaming, using a simple mapper which outputs the input strings not matched to your pattern. Analyse the result to improve the pattern. Escape backslashes and double quotes and the pattern from the mapper can be used in SERDEPROPERTIES \"input.regex\" variable unchanged. Example of the mapper:"
